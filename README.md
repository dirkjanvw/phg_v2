# PHG version 2
The Practical Haplotype Graph (PHG) is a powerful for representing pangenomes.  The PHG is optimized for the plant breeding and genetics context, where genomic diversity can be high and where imputation with low density markers is essential for breeding.

The PHG is a trellis graph based representation of genic and intergenic regions (called reference ranges or reference intervals) which represent diversity across and between taxa. It can be used to: create custom genomes for alignment, call rare alleles, impute genotypes, and efficiently store genomic data from many lines (i.e. reference, assemblies, and other lines).

PHGv1 was published in 2022 and solved many of the issues in aligning diverse genomes and imputing across a pangenome.  However, it relied
