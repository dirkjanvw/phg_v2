## Code of Conduct
Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Getting Started
The PHG_v2 project is written in Kotlin and uses the Gradle build system. To get started, you will need to install the following:
* [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

It is recommended to use an IDE to make any code changes.  Our group prefers using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

## How to Contribute
For any code changes, you will need to fork the PHG_v2 repository and create a pull request.  For more information on how to do this, please see [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

### Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug, please first check the [PHG_v2 issue tracker](https://github.com/maize-genetics/phg_v2/issues) to see 
if the bug has already been reported.  If it has not, please create a new issue with the bug report template.

### Suggesting Enhancements and New Features
If you have an idea for an enhancement, please create a new issue with the enhancement template in the [PHG_v2 issue tracker](https://github.com/maize-genetics/phg_v2/issues).

### Submitting Code Changes
To submit a code change, you first will need to fork the PHG_v2 repository, make your changes to your fork and then submit a Pull Request to the PHG_v2 repository.  For more information on how to do this, please see [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

When creating the Pull Request, fill out the Pull Request template with the relevant information and a description of the changes you made.  
Additionally, you can add reviewers to the Pull Request from the PHG team.  
If you are unsure of who should review, please add @zrm22 and additional reviewers will be assigned. 

After you have submitted your Pull Request, please verify that all of the automated checks have passed.  If any of the checks have failed, please review the error message and make any necessary changes to your code.  If you are unsure of how to fix the error, please reach out to the PHG team for assistance.

A member of the PHG team will review your Pull Request and provide feedback.  If any changes are requested, please make the requested changes and update your Pull Request.  Once the Pull Request has been approved, it will be merged into the PHG_v2 repository on the main branch and a new build will be automatically created and released.
