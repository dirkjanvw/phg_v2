# hVCF - Haplotype Variant Call Format

`version: 2.0`

## Overview
hVCF stands **h**aplotype **V**ariant **C**all **F**ormat. This format is used to store 
and encode haplotype information across samples from the PHG 
([Practical Haplotype Graph](https://github.com/maize-genetics/phg_v2)).
An hVCF file is based on the standards of a VCF file, specifically, 
[VCF v4.4](http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.4.pdf). This format leverages VCF's
symbolic allele information from the `ALT` field.
