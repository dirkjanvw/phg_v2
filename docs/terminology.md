# PHG v2 Terminology


Reference genome - the genome used for initial alignment and base coordinates
Reference range - a segment of the reference genome
Haplotype - the sequence of part of an individual chromosome with its start and stop defined by the reference range
Reference Haplotype - a haplotype from the reference genome
Alternate genome - the high quality genomes used to identify alternate haplotypes
Alternate haplotype - a haplotype derived from a genome assembly
Composite genome - the inferred genome based on its composite set of alternate and reference haplotypes
